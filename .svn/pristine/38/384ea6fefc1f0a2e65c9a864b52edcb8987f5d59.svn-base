New products and technologies are coming out frequently- check back often for updates on the latest cosmetic market trends! Belotera is one of the newest Hyaluronic Acid injectables, specifically developed for fine lines. Similar to collagen but longer lasting, this filler is perfect for the fine wrinkles and scars too small for other fillers to erase. Also, look for Allergan's new line of volumizing HA fillers. Due out this fall, these fillers will add more volume for less $$ in those patients who are hollow through the cheeks, temples and lower face.
