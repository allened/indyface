<span class="title1">My name is Janet</span> and I am a male to female transgendered person. I had several options available to me to complete my transition. I had heard several complimentary things about Winslow Facial Plastic Surgery and made an appointment for consultation. As a transgender I tend to be wary of professionals because not all approve of those of us who are changing our gender. Sometimes that disapproval ranges from cool professionalism to outright disdain as if they would prefer I go elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
After receiving a date for my initial visit I met with two ladies who could not have treated me with more kindness or understanding. They immediately put me at ease and treated me as one more woman who was there for information on life changing surgery. Dr. Winslow was all I hoped for and showed me how she could change my appearance to be more feminine. The Staff at the desk also treated me so kindly that I admit I was overwhelmed by their concern and helpfulness.
</p>

<p>
Because of the kindness and compassion for me as a transgendered I decided to pursue a wide range of surgical options for my face. I almost felt like I was a member of the family because of the care and compassion I was shown. My surgery was November 15th. As pleased as I was with my treatment during initial visits, I have been completely overwhelmed by the treatment during my after care. The surgery has changed my life drastically for the better. I no longer  wonder if I'll pass now because people now look at me and see a female. To a transgendered female that is quite important and greatly rewarding. 
</p>

<p>
In closing I would urge any prospective Winslow patient to proceed with their treatment. To say that I love each one of the Staff as a friend and sister is an understatement. Kindness and compassion are routine at Winslow Facial Plastic Surgery and those traits affected me deeply. I will, finances allowing, pursue more procedures there and only there!

<span class="title1">Phenomenal surgeon,</span> a staff that is beyond impressive. I've never left here unhappy. Prices are incredibly reasonable and they are constantly having holiday packages at a discount price. I never feel rushed when I'm here. Dr Winslow and her staff treat me like I'm the only patient that matters. I cannot rave enough about how incredible this facility is. Botox is typically under $15/unit and Juvederm is around $4-500/syringe. Radiesse is a bit more, but the injector is an expert and I always leave looking and feeling like a supermodel.

<span class="title1">A friend of mine once</span> said that a surgeon and fighter pilot must share the same type of personality: fearless, confident, determined, competent, and perfect. While I understand you were a Major in the United States Army and Chief of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Walter Reed, facts which I discovered on my own because they are no where evident in your office, I suspect that my friend's analysis is accurate in describing you, as a surgeon. The attributes which fighter pilots are not known to possess, but which you exude are kindness, gentleness, and a genuine caring for your patients. In your taking care of me, I felt like I was your only patient. You could not have made me feel more comfortable and at ease with the procedure or the recovery. As far as I am concerned, you set the standard. I would, without question or qualification, recommend you to anyone desiring your services.

<span class="title1">I just had to write you a note</span> and tell you that it took my husband and my (also carded - 26 year old) daughter to convince the waiter last night that I was old enough to drink. At age 54 it didn't occur to me that I would need my ID if I ordered wine at the restaurant! In retrospect, I really should have said, "Never mind, you caught me -- just bring me a diet coke!" This also happened several months ago when I bought a bottle of wine at Safeway. I did have my ID then. Boy that sales gal was surprised! I thought it would never happen again until last night. Anyway, I just thought you should know! THANK YOU so much again! This is FUN!

<span class="title1">Dr. Winslow is a hugely talented perfectionist</span> with a gentle touch, a sense of humor and a caring manner. I was amazed that she was able remove a bump on my nose with minimal bruising. I have found her to be forthright on the pros and cons of such procedures as the threadlift and thermage. As a woman, she relates particularly well to her patients. Triste' is highly capable, energetic and fun. She is informative and takes great care of her patients. And Kate is amazing. She possesses an artist's touch to properly arch and shape the brows. Then she is able to apply the permanent makeup without inflicting pain. I love these people!

<span class="title1">I would like to be placed on Dr. Winslow's</span> mailing list. My visit yesterday is still on my mind. A fan of the results of injectible fillers, I am not a fan of the procedure, i.e., hate needles, low tolerance for pain, anxiety. Looking for more personalized service, (meaning more gentle and attention to details), I gave your office a call. I cannot remember a more pleasant experience. You didn't rush, gentle, and made me feel that I was your only patient. Your staff is terrific, especially Triste, even though it was difficult to quit laughing! Thank you for standing out in this city as a truly caring physician.

<span class="title1">I just wanted to let you know</span> that I had a "Fantastic Experience" at your July Seminar. Your staff made me feel very welcome and comfortable. It was a lot of fun too.
</p>
<p>
This was my first time at your office & I received BOTOX&#174; injections. I had received BOTOX&#174; injections before from another physician whom also hosted an office seminar. But I have to say, the injection technique that your RN used on me far exceeded my previous injections and your seminar was more welcoming.
</p>
<p>
I just wanted to say thank you! I will definetly be back and I have told all my friends about my experience, too.

<span class="title1">I am only 10 days out from my surgery</span> and I just had to call in and tell you that I am getting compliments from strangers. I had a carpet cleaning service come today and the man whom I have never met wouldn't believe that I was as old as I am! I also visited a friend who works on the IUPUI campus and a 22 year old boy was talking to me like I was a college student! I am so excited about my results and so unexpectedly pleased at just 10 days.
</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<span class="title1">Thank you for the wonderful experience</span>  and successful outcome with my recent procedure!<br>
<u>I couldn't be happier!</u> The entire process was easy and painfree. I was pleasantly surprised how positive it was and that's due in large part to the friendly staff, Dr. Winslow's background and credentials and the strong preparation. </p>
