<strong>Micro-peel</strong><br>

<strong>Microdermabrasion</strong><br>
Microdermabrasion is a technique for removing the topmost layer of skin leaving it supple and vibrant. The DiamondTome&#8482 Wand removes this layer of skin by gently exfoliating the skin with natural diamond chips, while at the same time vacuuming the dead skin cells away in a sterile and controlled manner. Removing this outer layer of skin cells leaves a smoother texture and promotes the growth of healthy new skin cells. The treatment is used to diminish the appearance of scars, acne scarring, facial spots and wrinkles. Microdermabrasion requires no downtime after the treatment. Normal activities may be resumed immediately.
