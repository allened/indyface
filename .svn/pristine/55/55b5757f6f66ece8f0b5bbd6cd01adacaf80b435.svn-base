<strong>What is the difference between facials and peels?</strong><br>
Facials are a feel good, relaxing, deep cleansing of the skin. Typically they include cleansing the face, masque for 10 minutes, followed by massage. Benefits include increased blood flow to the skin and removal of dead skin cells from the surface to result in a healthy glow. Peels incorporate acid, which irritate the live skin cells causing them to slough off, revealing the healthy plump skin cells underneath. This also causes the skin to go into "healing mode", which jump starts the body's production of collagen and elastin in the dermis to thicken the skin and soften fine lines and wrinkles. Peels range in strength and can be as mild as "no down time", meaning you can put on your make up right afterwards and go about all normal activities, to being red, irritated, and having your skin peel for 3-5 days. Which one is right for you depend on your skin condition, life style, and skin objectives. Your aesthetician can help you determine what is appropriate for you.

<strong>Why do I need a peel?</strong><br>
Skin cells are made at the base of the epidermis and take 28-30 days to reach the surface of the skin when we're younger than 30. After the age of 30 this process slows down, the older we are the slower the process. That's why we start to see the roughness, dullness, fine lines, and increased hyperpigmentation (brown spots). Chemical peels irritate those aging skin cells to reveal the younger plumper skin cells underneath. The body rejuvenates new skin cells more quickly. A peel also stimulates the body to create more collagen and elastin which thickens the skin to minimize fine lines.

<strong>Help, I have acne! What can I do to get rid of it?</strong><br>
Fortunately, we have many treatment options available! Depending on the severity of your acne it could be as easy to clear up as having a MicroPeel once a month along with using good cosmeceutical grade products at home. For more severe acne, prescription strength products and light-based treatments will assist in controlling the surface oils and bacteria. Consultations are free and are required to determine which treatment is right for you.

<strong>What is a MicroPeel?</strong><br>
A revolutionary process that removes a micro-thin top layer of dead skin. The benefits are improved skin clarity, tone, and texture. Suitable for all skin types and conditions. This peel removes unwanted "peach fuzz" and includes Cryogenic Therapy or "dry ice", which kills bacteria and makes pores look smaller and skin feel smoother! No down-time is required and makeup can be applied immediately after.

<strong>I have "unwanted" hair on my chin, how do I get rid of it?</strong><br>
Technology has really advance in the areas of hair removal! No longer do we have to deal with tweezing and waxing! Today's lasers offer effective permanent hair reduction. IPL treatments are performed in our medical office, so you know you are getting the best care and follow-up available. Treatments are scheduled 4-6 weeks apart and require 8-10 treatments for 85% or greater hair reduction. Typically what hair is left is much finer and lighter in color, and results are typically seen after one treatment!

<p>
<strong>Why does it take so many treatments for hair removal?</strong><br>
Light is attracted to the melanin on the hair shaft while in the active growth phase (anagen phase) of the hair cycle. Not all hair follicles are in the anagen phase at the same time. If there is enough heat that is absorbed by the anatomical structures of the hair follicle, it will disable the process of regenerating a new hair. If not enough heat is absorbed to disable the new growth, these hairs will be altered, eventually growing finer and lighter. It is impossible to achieve maximum benefits from the hair removal treatments, unless a patient has at least six treatments. From our experience, for some patients it may take more than six treatments. Also, depending on the anatomical area, skin type, hair type, age of patient, genetics, and gender, every patient will achieve results at a different rate. The good news is that most patients will achieve great permanent reduction and what hair is left is cosmetically acceptable and manageable!

<strong>What are "cosmeceutical" products and how are they different than what I get over the counter?</strong><br>
Cosmeceutical products can only be sold in a doctor's office or under the supervision of a physician due to the active agents in them and their ability to change the structure of the skin. They typically contain higher percentages of vitamins to help the skin build healthy skin cells then do cosmetics. Typically "over the counter" products are going to use cheaper ingredients and fillers and are more likely to cause skin irritations then a cosmeceutical product. The other advantage of getting a cosmeceutical product is that because it's sold in a physician's office you'll get the proper evaluation of your skins needs and therefore not playing the "guessing game" and wasting your money on products not needed or that don't work!
