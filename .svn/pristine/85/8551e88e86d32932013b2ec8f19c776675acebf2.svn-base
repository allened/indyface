    <strong>Before Tanning:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Exfoliate your body before application.</li>
      <li>Do not apply moisturizers at this stage, it will only reduce the final result.</li>
      <li>Wear suitable attire, bathing suit or undergarments</li>
     </ul>

    <strong>After Tanning:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not get wet for at least 4-6 hours after your tanning session.  We recommend dark loose fitting attire after your appointment, any minor rub off will easily wash out of most fabrics</li>
      <li>Do not shower for at least four hours. We also suggest to not exercise or perspire excessively until after your initial shower.  </li>
      <li>When showering, do not be concerned if some of the non-transdermal tint comes off, it is part of the Sun Spray Tanning process.</li>
      <li>Apply moisturizer twice daily after showering.  This reduces the rate at which your skin naturally exfoliates.  It will also help extend the life of your tan. </li>
     </ul>
