Many people are looking for non-surgical, no-downtime options to look their best for photos and gatherings. With the immense popularity and effectiveness of BOTOX&#174;, this is the leader in non-invasive perks sought by patients. BOTOX&#174; works well for eye area and forehead, but can make the face look unnatural if injected around the mouth. I much prefer fillers in this area.
As our face ages, it loses fat and volume. This is very noticeable around the mouth as we develop smile lines, puppet lines and flat lips. Fillers are substances injected with a tiny needle that restore volume (and youth) by placement of a substance underneath the skin. The substance injected will determine the longevity of results. Longer lasting injectables are frequently being introduced.
</p>

<p>
Collagen was one of the first injectables introduced. It is deposited directly under the skin for improvements of fine lines and wrinkles. The injections last 1 to 3 months on average. Some collagen preparations are made from bovine (cow) derivatives, and these require skin testing prior to injection. A collagen derived from pigs (it is kosher!), Evolence, is now available and offers much greater longevity.
</p>

<p>
A need for a longer lasting injectable spurred the development of hyaluronic acid preparations. Currently, there are several forms of hyaluronic acid on the market, and these comprise the most popular class of injectables. Most last for 6 to 8 months and gradually are removed by an enzyme that is naturally present in the skin. This enzyme can also be injected to help contour filler if requested. Hyaluonic preparations include Restylane, Captique, Hylaform and JUV&#201;DERM&#174;. Captique and Hylaform were shorted acting and are no longer available. Restylane and Perlane persist for 4-6 months on average. JUV&#201;DERM&#174; has an FDA indication and has been shown to last 8-12 months.
</p>

<p>
Radiesse and Sculptra are now widely available long-lasting injectables. Radiesse is made of bony mineral paste and lasts for 6-12 months. It can be used for volume improvements in the smile lines, pre-jowl area, cheekbones or under the cheekbones, or along the brow (to achieve a subtle "lift"). Results are apparent immediately, although a touch-up may help in achieving optimal results. The discomfort and swelling with injection is slightly more than that of the hyaluronic fillers. Sculptra is poly L-lactic acid and is used primarily in the deep tissues of the cheek to fill in large volume deficiencies. It is approved for HIV associated fat loss in the face. Injections may take 6-8 weeks before results are seen, and several treatments may be necessary.
</p>

<p>
Artefill is currently the only FDA approved filler that is permanent. The manufacturer, Artes Medical, is no longer in business and limited quantities are still available. It is made of polymethylmethacrylate beads suspended in collagen and lidocaine. Skin testing is required one month prior to injection. The filler is used for the smile lines (melolabial folds) and patient satisfaction is excellent. It is not generally recommended for patients as an initial treatment, but for those looking for permanence after achieving satisfaction with a temporary filler.<br>
All injections can be performed in a doctor's office under numbing cream or blocks (numbing shots, like dentists use). Ice and Tylenol are generally all that required after injections. Avoiding ibuprofen, aspirin, naproxen and similar blood-thinning anti-inflammatory medicines will minimize bruising (which is usually minimal). Massage after injections may be recommended.
</p>

<p>
A perfect "gift-wrapping" for the face, fillers will help you look your best for holiday photos, and keep people guessing!

<p>
<span class="title1">BOTOX&#174;</span><br>
Botulinum toxin- sound scary? It should- it is the most potent toxin known to man! Even so, BOTOX&#174; use has been increasing dramatically each year around the country. BOTOX&#174; is purified Botulinum toxin- made in a lab and specially packaged. Each container of BOTOX&#174; has a very specific amount, and the result is based on the amount injected. There is very little fluctuation from person to person with the recommended dosages. This makes it very safe and effective- and reproducible with each injection.
</p>

<p>
The benefits of BOTOX&#174; are enormous. BOTOX&#174; started out with use in strabismus- kids with crossed eyes. The cosmetic improvements around the eyes were quite apparent, and now it is used for the area between the brow, the crow's feet area and the forehead for both prevention and treatment. It has many other uses, and it is still being investigated. It can be used for hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), facial tics and Bell's Palsy, muscle spasms around the eye and even for cerebral palsy muscle spasms. It works by blocking the release of a neurotransmitter across a muscle junction. This weakens the muscle. Unfortunately, the results are short-lived, and the muscle returns to normal in 4-6 months. BOTOX&#174; typically takes 2-7 days before any effect is seen, and continued improvements in wrinkles and fine lines may be apparent for the duration of its activity. It has received FDA approval for many uses, including cosmetic, and it is very safe in trained hands.
</p>

<p>
The downsides to BOTOX&#174; primarily lie in the fact that it does not produce permanent changes, and is quite expensive. An injection can cost $100-500, depending on the number of sites and amount of BOTOX&#174; injected. These injections must be repeated every 4 to 6 months to achieve the best results. It is not recommended for women who are pregnant or breast feeding. Side effects are relatively rare but may include a bruise at the site of injection, headache, or ptosis (a droopiness of the eyelid). All side effects are also temporary.
</p>

<p>
Do I like BOTOX&#174;? I love it! It is the best treatment for wrinkles around the eyes, forehead and glabella there is and there is no down-time. Injections are quick and painless and results start occurring in a couple of days. I do not like it around the mouth in most patients- I think that with a few exceptions, it will affect the mobility and expressiveness of the mouth that is noticeable (apparent that you have had "something done"). I personally recommend fillers (such as JUVÃ‰DERM&#174;) for most smile lines and puppet lines around the mouth.

BOTOX ?<br>
DYSPORT?<br>
What is the difference? <br>
Are they different?<br>
</h3>
</p>

<p>
<span class="title1">BOTOX&#174; Cosmetic</span>
 is a prescription medicine that is injected into muscles and used to improve the look of moderate to severe frown lines between the eyebrows (glabellar lines) in people 18 to 65 years temporarily. (Allergan) Dysport is a prescription injection for temporary improvement in the look of moderate to severe frown lines between the eyebrows (glabellar lines) in adults less than 65 years of age. (Medicis) 
</p>

<div class="well">
<p>
<span class="title1"><u>The Similarities</u></span><br> 
Both Dysport and Botox are botulinum toxin type A proteins that are injected into the facial muscles that cause wrinkles. The toxin paralyzes the muscles which in turn results in fewer frown lines and wrinkles. 
The resulting cosmetic appearance delivered by both drugs seems to last about the same amount of time.
The difference in treatment cost is negligible.
Side effects of both treatments are similar and include numbness in the area that is being treated, as well as the possibility of swelling or bruising which can be relieved using an ice pack after treatment. 
</p>
</div>

<div class="well">
<p>
<span class="title1"><u>The Differences</u></span><br> 
Dysport may not last quite as long (duration of efficacy). This is still being debated and studied; Dysport has a slightly quicker onset (2-5 days vs 4-7 days for Botox) in some people. Dysport  appears to diffuses more (i.e., spreads to a wider area). This is an advantage in some areas of the face and a disadvantage in others; This means that larger areas can be treated with fewer needle sticks. On the other hand, for smaller areas like under the eyes, it can be difficult to control the spread of the toxin so that it doesn't go beyond the area it was intended to treat. While the cost of Dysport is less, more is required for the same effects delivered by Botox.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Ultimately, it is far more important WHO is injecting your Botox or Dysport, than which of these two products you are using. Botox/Dysport mistakes and bad results are made by people, not the product. Please meet with our experienced injectors prior to choosing a wrinkle-removing injectable and to discuss alternatives to Botox
</p>

<p>
<span class="title1">Risks of BOTOX&#174; and fillers</span><br>
All injectables aside from Artefill are temporary and need to be repeated to maintain results. Longevity varies based on product selected. Swelling and bruising are possible; other possible complications are rare but will be reviewed at your appointment. 
TO MINIMIZE BRUISING: we strongly recommend discontinuing aspirin, Ibuprofen, Advil, Motrin and all over-the-counter pain medications aside from Tylenol for 2 weeks prior to injection. Ice may be gently applied post-injection. Avoid all herbal supplements for 2 weeks prior to injection as many, such as fish oil, glucosamine, chondroitin and many others will increase your risk of bruising. Bruising is possible with any injection, please plan appropriately!

<span class="title1">Lipodissolve</span><br>
<strong>Q. I am hearing about a new treatment that dissolves fat without surgery called LipoDissolve. Does this really work?</strong><br>
Thankfully, yes it does! In fact, it works very well!! Unfortunately, there is a lot of "miss-information" out there, much of it coming from practitioners who do not have any experience with LipoDissolve. Here are the facts:
</p>
<p>
LipoDissolve is a clinically proven and safe treatment to permanently eliminate fat. It works best on areas that seem to be resistant to diet and exercise, including the abdomen, love handles, thighs. Chin/jowls, buttocks, etc.
</p>
<p>
LipoDissolve involves a series of micro-injections which consist mainly of naturally occurring substances call Phosphatidycholine (PPC) and Deoxycholate (DC). PPC disrupts the fat cell membrane, causing the cells to burst and release their enzymes and fatty content. An inflammatory response follows allowing the debris to be "cleaned up" by your body. The affected fat is then excreted naturally by the body. The fat cells that are affected are gone for good!
</p>
<p>
In over 50,000 documented cosmetic cases, LipoDissolve has been proven safe with no adverse side effects.<br>
In a recent clinical study by a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon in Colorado, only 4% of treated patients were non-responsive to LipoDissolve.
</p>
<p>
LipoDissolve is NOT the same as Mesotherapy. This is a common question we hear, and they are very different treatments. Mesotherapy is a series of very superficial injections into the mesoderm (just under the skin) using a vast mixture of different substances. LipoDissolve utilizes injections directly in to fat, and only targets the fat, utilizing only the two substances mentioned above.
</p>
<p>
LipoDissolve is not a weight-loss program, but a body contouring program. You will see changes in inches, not pounds. LipoDissolve can be a very nice alternative to liposuction, and there is not anesthesia and very little downtime. It can also compliment liposuction as well.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Q. What is LipoDissolve&#174;?</strong><br>
LipoDissolve&#174; is a treatment utilizing a combination of naturally occurring compounds administered through a series of micro-injections for the purpose of subcutaneous fat reduction. LipoDissolve&#174; injections reduce the size of localized fat deposits and cause skin retraction in body regions where treated. It is an excellent non-surgical alternative for those patients seeking minimally invasive techniques to improve body contour. It is not a treatment for weight reduction but rather a procedure for improving shape and reducing targeted fat.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Q. What are the chemicals being injected?</strong><br>
LipoDissolve&#174; consists of phosphatidycholine and deoxycholate (fosfa-tid-ul-koleen and de-oxy-kolate). Phosphatidycholine (PPC) is a naturally occurring substance within the body that comprises up to 60% of cell membranes, facilitates cell membrane transport, and is a component in bile that is responsible for emulsifying the fat we consume in our diet for absorption. The PPC used in most injectable fat reducing formulas is derived from the soybean lecithin. Deoxycholate, present in the body as sodium deoxycholate, is a bile salt that functions to make the PPC soluble in water. It acts as a detergent and also aids in the breakdown of fat consumed in our diet. Benzyl alcohol is present in the solution as a preservative and antimicrobial.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Q. How does it work?</strong><br>
First the injected solution disrupts the fat cell membrane. This causes the cells to burst, releasing their enzymes and fatty content. Second, an inflammatory response ensues, allowing the debris to be "cleaned up" by the macrophages that have migrated to the area. This inflammation is responsible for the redness and soreness but also allows for tissue retraction. Lastly, new collagen is deposited in the area, causing skin retraction with denser, firmer skin character. The fat and cellular debris that are removed are collected as waste and excreted through the body's normal metabolic pathways (urine and feces).
</p>


<p>
<strong>Q. Is this procedure safe?</strong><br>
LipoDissolve&#174; is very safe when injected in appropriate candidates by trained practitioners using a standardized solution. It is supported by clinical studies and research in South America, Europe and in the U.S. PCC was first isolated in 1959 in Russia and used for the intravenous treatment of fat embolism. Since then, many other uses have been identified with IV or oral use including improvement in: cardiac disease, elevated triglycerides and cholesterol, liver conditions, bipolar depression, Alzheimer's syndrome, hypothyroidism, and insulin resistance. In 1988, the first injections for cosmetic uses where reported with success. As of 2005, in the U.S. and other countries, more than 50,000 patients have been treated with successful cosmetic improvement and no long-term side effects or complications.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Q. Does it hurt and what are the side-effects?</strong><br>
Several injections are delivered in the treated area using a small gauge needle. Most people experience only mild discomfort that is very tolerable. Common side-effects are a burning or stinging sensation that frequently lasts for up to an hour after the injections. Taking Tylenol before treatment can help minimize this. Some patients will notice bruising or discoloration that fades with time. All patients experience mild to significant localized swelling and redness in the treated area. This is normal and expected. The majority of the swelling will subside after 2-3 days. Occasionally, an itching sensation is described as the inflammation resolves, taking Benedryl can help alleviate this. Patients will notice the formation of slightly tender lumps or nodules under the skin, which is expected as the fat is dissolved. This reaction is temporary.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Q. How do I know if I am a candidate?</strong><br>
Each patient will receive a complimentary consultation and medical evaluation by our certified practitioners and physicians. During this meeting, a medical history questionnaire will be reviewed with you allowing any concerns to be addressed. There are some medical conditions that will prevent a patient from being treated and these will be discussed with you at the time of the evaluation. The ideal candidate is healthy and is within range of their medically ideal body weight with respect to their height. This procedure works best for those with isolated problem areas that are resistant to diet and exercise and not for those seeking to lose weight.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Q. What are the areas that can be treated and how often?</strong><br>
LipoDissolve&#174; is ideal for treating the lower eye pads, chin, abdomen, upper/lower back, upper arms, hips, thighs, knees, buttocks, and love handles. It is also utilized for treating the following conditions: gynecomastia, lipomas, surgical deformities, and uneven contour from liposuction.
The frequency of your treatments will depend on the body area and how much fat needs to be dissolved. Typically patients will return every 2-4 weeks for 4-6 treatments.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Q.Is there any downtime and how soon will I see results?</strong><br>
One of the advantages of LipoDissolve&#174; versus surgical alternatives is that it is minimally invasive and patients can typically return to normal activity immediately. While some tenderness and discomfort is to be expected, and overall the treatments are very well tolerated. Perhaps that is why some have dubbed this procedure "lunchtime lipo". The minimal disruption in their daily schedule is why most find this procedure very appealing. On the average, patients begin to see noticeable improvement after 2-4 sessions. While many experience results sooner, we cannot guarantee this. Often, we inform patients that for the first several weeks while the body's inflammatory response is prominent, they will feel "bloated" in the treated area. This is expected and only temporary. Once the body begins metabolizing the fat, contour improvement occurs.
