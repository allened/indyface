When the pulse of light is delivered, some patients experience a mild pinching or stinging sensation. No local anesthesia or pain medication is typically required; however, some patients may prefer to use a topical anesthetic when sensitive areas are treated.

<h3>What is the LimeLight Facial?</h3>
<p>
The LimeLight Facial is a new, non-invasive approach to treating benign pigmented and vascular lesions using Cutera's LimeLight. The procedure offers the advantage of improving skin tone and surface imperfections associated with aging and photodamage.
</p>
<p>
The LimeLight Facial is ideal for any part of your face, neck and d&#233;collet&#233; with skin redness, telangiectasia (tiny veins) or brown spots. Light (low contrast) brown spots, which were previously difficult to resolve, respond very well to treatment.

The Laser Genesis procedure has been scientifically proven to diminsh the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles by producing new collagen.

<h3>The Laser Genesis difference.</h3>


<p>
The Laser Genesis procedure utilizes non-invasive laser technology to safely, discretely and effectively treat fine-line wrinkles, diffuse and excessive redness and scars. You can expect to see subtle yet consistent results after each treatment, without unwanted side effects such as bruising or excessive skin irritation. Treatments can be performed in a relaxed, comfortable manner without the use of topical anesthetics or gel.

<h3>The Pearl</h3>
<p>
The Pearl procedure combines resurfacing lasers with
gentle and safe non-invasive procedures to treat aging
and sun-damaged skin. Pearl reduces fine wrinkles,
uneven texture and sun damage with fewer treatments
and less overall recovery than other technologies to
provide a healthy, pearl-like glow
</p>
<p>
During the procedure, the top layer of skin is treated
with pulses of light in a pre-selected pattern. The laser
simultaneously sends heat to the deeper layers of skin
to provide longer-term benefits. A natural protective
dressing forms on the skin to minimize downtime
during the restorative process. On day 3 or 4, this
natural dressing will peel or slough off, revealing new,
healthy, vibrant skin underneath.
In a short time, patients will notice overall skin clarity,
smoothness and softness - all from a 15 minute
treatment with only 3 - 4 days of “social” downtime

<h3>The Titan</h3>
<p>
Titan utilizes a safe infrared light to heat the dermis
well below the skin’s surface. During the
procedure, the skin’s top surface (epidermis) is
protected through continuous cooling with the
Titan handpiece.
Titan’s light-based platform provides a more
uniform distribution of energy for heating the deep
dermis than other energy sources, such as RF
(radio- frequency).

<h3>The Cutera CoolGlide difference</h3>
<p>
The Cutera CoolGlide combines the ideal laser wavelength with the
most flexible parameters to deliver a superior vascular laser system.
It treats a broad range of vessels from tiny spider veins to deep blue
reticular veins quickly, safely, and effectively. Patients with dark, light
or tanned skin can experience outstanding results with minimal
bruising or blistering.
</p>

<strong>How does CoolGlide Vein Therapy work?</strong>
<p>
The Cutera CoolGlide systems deliver pulses of light energy which
cause the blood within the vein to coagulate, eventually destroying
the vessel which is later reabsorbed by your body. Blood flow will
then be redirected to veins deeper below your skin’s surface, where
it should be.
