<p>
Otoplasty refers to pinning the ears back. Prominent ears are usually present at birth, and often run in the family. Because children can endure cruel teasing from peers, ear pinning (otoplasty) is usually performed as the child prepares for school- age 5-6. Most of the ear growth is complete, and children can comply with post-operative instructions. Adults are also candidates for the procedure. Adult otoplasty procedures can greatly enhance self-esteem. Adult otoplasty procedures are usually performed under local or a light sedation, whereas children require a general anesthetic. Surgery takes about 1-2 hours and is outpatient. The procedure involved a cut behind the ear that heals in about a week. Pain is usually minimal to moderate and easily controlled with narcotics. Otoplasty results are immediate. A light dressing, similar to a headband, is recommended for one week and at night for several months. Normal activity can be resumed in about a week. Insurance will often cover children; adults are usually not covered. An otoplasty can be performed on one ear or both, depending on the individual.
