        Triste began her nursing career at Riley Hospital and joined Dr. Winslow from the very beginning when she opened her practice. As a nurse injector, she strives to provide excellent care and only the best customer service. This commitment has made WFPS a Diamond Provider for Allergan - which means we provide more BOTOX&#174;, JUV&#201;DERM&#174; and Latisse than almost any other office in Indiana.
        </p>
		<p>
As the only ACE injector in Indiana (an honor given to her by Allergan) Triste has put WFPS in the top 1.5% nationally in customer retention - which translates into many happy patients! Triste also serves as an ACE trainer for Allergan.
		</p>
		<p>
Triste loves her job! She takes pride in every aspect of her job, especially with her patients in assisting them to look and feel their best - and it shows!
