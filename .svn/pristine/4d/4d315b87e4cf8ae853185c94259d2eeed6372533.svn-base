<h1>Laser Hair Removal</h1>
<h3>in Indianapolis and Carmel Indiana</h3>

<p>
Hair Removal is gentle intense pulsed light treatment that can be performed just about anywhere that pigmented hair grows, with little or no downtime!
</p>

<p>Hair Removal is non-invasive and fast! Nothing penetrates the skin, and multiple hairs area treated with each pulse. The intense pulsed light targets the melanin in the hair follicle causing thermal damage to the hair growth cells without normal skin. Each treatment reduces the number and size of hair follicles in the area until you reach the desired result.

<p>
Prior to the treatment, shave the area you want treated. This allows all the energy to be absorbed in the hair follicle and not the shaft. Patients should have no sun exposure two weeks before treatment and one week following a treatment.
</p>

<p>
The treated area will feel like a very mild sunburn and may be slightly pink for a few hours. Hair follicles in the skin may be red and swollen. Many patients have the treatment during there lunch hour and are able to return to work.
</p>

<p>
Hair that is damaged by the treatment is still in the hair shaft and will gradually shed within the next two weeks.

<p>
Treatments usually take about 10 min for underarm and 1 hour for lower legs. Treatment time is dependent on the size of the treated area. Treatments are done once every 4-6 weeks and eight to twelve treatments are needed for desired results. We do offer a discount when treatments are purchased as a package as compared to paying as you go.
