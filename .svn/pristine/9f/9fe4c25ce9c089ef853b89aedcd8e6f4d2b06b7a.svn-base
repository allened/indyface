What is Acupuncture/Traditional Chinese Medicine
</p>

<p>
Constitutional Facial Acupuncture is a safe, painless and effective treatment for renewing your face as well as your whole body. Fine lines may be entirely erased, deeper lines reduced and bags around neck and eyes firmed. With this type of treatment you should look and feel 5 to 15 years younger!
Fine needles are placed at a variety of acupuncture points on your face, neck and around the eyes to stimulate your body's natural energies, or Qi. Since muscle groups are addressed your face lifts itself through your muscles' toning and tightening action. The needles also stimulate collagen production, increase blood and chi flow which improves your facial color, vitality, and texture.
