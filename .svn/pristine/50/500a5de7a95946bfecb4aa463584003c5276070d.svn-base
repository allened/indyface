<p>
<strong>Q: What is a pulsed dye laser?</strong><br>
A: The pulsed dye laser was designed to rid patients of benign vascular lesions. 

</p>

<p>
<strong>Q: How does a pulsed dye laser work?</strong><br>
A: The laser delivers an intense but gentle burst of yellow light to the skin. The light is specifically absorbed by the blood vessels in the dermis. These blood vessels are coagulated and then reabsorbed by the body during the natural healing process.

</p>

<p>
<strong>Q: Is the treatment safe?</strong><br>
A: Yes. In fact, pulse dyed laser treatment is so safe that it has been used successfully for the treatment of port wine stains in infants and young children. The epidermis is protected during the treatment by Candela's unique dynamic cooling method, DCD., which sprays a cooling mist onto the skin before each laser pulse, increasing the patient's comfort. Side effects may include purpura (a laser bruise), redness, and swelling in the treated area. These are transient and usually do not last more than a few days. Permanent side effects such as scarring are rare.

<p>
<strong>Q: What will the treatment consist of?
</strong><br>
A: The laser treatment will include the following:
<ul>
	<li>Wearing safety eyewear to protect your eyes from the laser light.</li>
    <li>A small hand piece will be applied to the treatment area by the practitioner to deliver the laser energy.</li>
    <li>A spray of cooling mist will be felt prior to each laser pulse.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p>
<strong>Q: Is the treatment painful?</strong><br>
A: Some patients may feel a slight discomfort associated with the laser pulse. The feeling has been described by patients as the snapping of a rubber band on the skin. This discomfort is minimized by Candela's dynamic cooling device. In addition, for some patients, a topical anesthetic may be used prior to treatment. Be sure to discuss this with your practitioner. 
</p>


<p>
<strong>Q: What precautions should be taken before and after pulsed dye laser treatment?</strong><br>
A: It is recommended to avoid sun exposure before and throughout the course of treatment. A sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher) should be used. The post treatment care needed depends on what lesion was treated. Be sure to discuss this with your practitioner before treatment. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Q: Are the procedures covered by insurance?</strong><br>
A: Most insurance companies do not offer reimbursement for cosmetic procedures.
