One of the most commonly performed procedures in our Carmel, IN procedure suite is a minilift or facelift.  Using incisions that are hidden in the natural contours of the ear, this is a fantastic procedure for lifting sagging jowls, neck and midface skin. The deeper tissues are lifted to restore youth to the midface and neck. A facelift or minilift very nicely addresses aging below the cheekbones; for aging around the eyes or forehead, a blepharoplasty or browlift may also be recommended. These procedures can be performed at the same time, if desired. The result after a facelift or minilift is a natural, refreshed appearance with no visible scarring. The procedures are performed under twilight sedation, using medicines given through an IV. Avoiding general anesthetic often means less nausea and a faster recovery. Most facelifts and minilifts are performed in our fully accredited procedure suite located in our Carmel, IN office. Pain is usually described as less than expected, and patients are able to eat and drink as soon as they get home. Downtime after a facelift or minilift is one week with restrictions on activity and lifting to minimize bruising and swelling. Complications are rare and results are immediate.

A Rejuvalift is a very minimal version of the minlift procedure, with smaller incisions and quicker healing. The results are still quite impressive and this is an ideal procedure for a younger patient with less facial aging.

While the results with surgery are permanent, your face is not- and will continue to age at a rate based on genetics, sun exposure, your habits (smoking!) and the care you give your body and mind. In general, expect the results to "last" 8-10 years, before you might be ready for another lift.  A nice adjunct to restoring youth to the lower face is to add volume to aging lips with your own tissue at the same time. Adding your own tissues avoids the need for foreign implants, gives a permanent result and feels very soft and natural.

<h3>Are you a candidate for a facelift or minilift?</h3>
The best way to determine that is through a consultation with Dr. Winslow in her Carmel, IN office. Photo morphing is available to show realistic before/after images.
