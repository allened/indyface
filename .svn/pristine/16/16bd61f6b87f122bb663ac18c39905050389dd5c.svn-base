        	<span class="title1">The second floor of the Wellness Center</span> is the home of Winslow Facial Plastic Surgery. Here, you can experience the highest quality aesthetic, non-surgical and surgical rejuvenation available. Procedures performed by Dr. Winslow are done under sedation in our fully accredited facility located on the second floor. Cosmetic acupuncture, injectable fillers and BOTOX&#174;, laser hair removal, laser vascular treatment, laser rejuvenation, aesthetic services, peels, massage, makeup and physician-grade skin care are a few of the non-surgical services available. We are DIAMOND-level Allergan providers, the highest tier of Allergan sales tiers but more importantly, have the only ACE-certified nurse injector in the state. While the Diamond level is impressive in terms of volume of BOTOX&#174; and JUV&#201;DERM&#174; injections, only the ACE certification correlates to PATIENT SATISFACTION and RESULTS.
