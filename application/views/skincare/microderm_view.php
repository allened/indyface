<h3>IN INDIANAPOLIS AND CARMEL INDIANA</h3>

<p>
Microdermabrasion is an effective treatment to improve the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, brown spots, scars, and acne blemishes. DiamondSkin is a crystal-free microdermabrasion machine that utilizes natural diamond chips plated to a stainless steel surgical wand that effectively polishes away dead skin layers to expose healthier skin and promote new growth.
</p>

<p>
Resurfacing using a DiamondSkin is similar to particle microdermabrasion and chemical peels in its results, but without the adverse effects of loose Aluminum-Oxide particles, skin irritation, and other adverse skin reactions. Unlike other exfoliation treatments, the DiamondSkin system uses no loose abrasives to contaminate you or the environment.

This FDA-approved treatment is setting a new standard for skin care. The procedure is fast, predictable, and painless!
