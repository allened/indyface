<h3>in Indianapolis and Carmel Indiana</h3>

<p>
This unique MICROPIGMENTATION procedure is available in a variety of permanent cosmetic enhancements such as eyebrows, eye liner and lips as well as for areola restoration, hairline enhancement and more.  These procedures are ideal for those who are physically unable, too busy or inconvenienced by daily make-up application or for those who have allergies to conventional make-up. There is a wide variety of colors available and every procedure done at Winslow Facial Plastic Surgery&#169; includes local anesthesia to make the process more comfortable for the patient.  Complete healing takes one to six weeks while the pigmentation matures and reaches its final color, but normal activities may be resumed immediately after the procedure.
