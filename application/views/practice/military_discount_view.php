<h1>Military Discount</h1>

<p>
 As a former soldier who has served in both the Indiana National Guard as well as on Active Duty, in addition to being married to a senior officer in the
    Indiana National Guard, Dr. Winslow has a strong personal commitment to helping the military men and women who serve our country. At Winslow Facial Plastic
    Surgery we have started a program instituting a military discount for all service members, spouses, dependents and retirees. Bring in your military ID or
    DD214 and receive a 25% discount off the regular price of any service or product- no questions asked, but a big thank you given.
